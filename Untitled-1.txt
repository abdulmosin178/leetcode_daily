  {q:"What is bytecode?",a:"Intermediate code executed by JVM."},
  {q:"== vs equals()?",a:"== compares reference, equals compares content."},
  {q:"Ternary operator?",a:"Shortcut for if-else condition."},
  {q:"instanceof operator?",a:"Checks object type."},
  {q:"& vs &&?",a:"&& is short-circuit, & evaluates both."},
  {q:"| vs ||?",a:"|| is short-circuit OR operator."},
  {q:"Unary operator?",a:"Operates on single operand."},
  {q:"Bitwise operator?",a:"Works on binary values."},
  {q:"Control statements?",a:"if, switch, loops."},
  {q:"for loop?",a:"Used when iteration count is known."},
  {q:"while loop?",a:"Runs while condition is true."},
  {q:"do-while loop?",a:"Executes at least once."},
  {q:"break statement?",a:"Terminates loop."},
  {q:"continue statement?",a:"Skips current iteration."},
  {q:"Switch statement?",a:"Multiple branching based on value."},
  {q:"Can switch use String?",a:"Yes, from Java 7."},
  {q:"What is array?",a:"Fixed-size collection of same data type."},
  {q:"Array vs ArrayList?",a:"Array is fixed, ArrayList is dynamic."},
  {q:"Jagged array?",a:"Array of arrays with different sizes."},
  {q:"ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?",a:"Occurs on invalid index access."},

  {q:"What is String?",a:"Immutable sequence of characters."},
  {q:"Why String immutable?",a:"Security, caching, thread safety."},
  {q:"String vs StringBuilder?",a:"String immutable, StringBuilder mutable."},
  {q:"StringBuilder vs StringBuffer?",a:"StringBuffer is thread-safe."},
  {q:"String pool?",a:"Memory area for string literals."},
